Introduction
============

A workshop/tutorial for Python/Django developers who would like to contribute
more to the projects they use, but need more grounding in some of the tools
required.

The workshop will take participants through the complete cycle of identifying a simple issue in a
Django or Python project, writing a patch with documentation, and submitting it.

The purpose of the workshop
---------------------------

**Don't be afraid to commit** will help put you in a position to commit
successfully to collaborative projects.

You'll find it particularly useful if you think you have some good coding
ideas, but find that managing the development process sometimes gets in the
way of your actual development.

What's covered
--------------

**virtualenv** and **pip** will help you manage your own work in a more
streamlined and efficient way.

**Git** and **GitHub** will also help you manage your own workflow and
development, and will make it possible for you to collaborate effectively with
others. The Django Project, like many other open projects, uses both.

**Documentation** - being able to create, manage and publish documentation in
an efficient and orderly way will make your work more accessible and more
interesting to other people.

**Contributing** - how to submit your work
